    <div class="entry-content"><p>In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a <em>good fit</em> could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.</p>
<p>The dataset for this project originates from the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing">UCI Machine Learning Repository</a>. The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:
- 16 data points have an <code>'MEDV'</code> value of 50.0. These data points likely contain <strong>missing or censored values</strong> and have been removed.
- 1 data point has an <code>'RM'</code> value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an <strong>outlier</strong> and has been removed.
- The features <code>'RM'</code>, <code>'LSTAT'</code>, <code>'PTRATIO'</code>, and <code>'MEDV'</code> are essential. The remaining <strong>non-relevant features</strong> have been excluded.
- The feature <code>'MEDV'</code> has been <strong>multiplicatively scaled</strong> to account for 35 years of market inflation.</p>
<p>Run the code cell below to load the Boston housing dataset, along with a few of the necessary Python libraries required for this project. You will know the dataset loaded successfully if the size of the dataset is reported.</p>

<h2>Data Exploration</h2>
<p>In this first section of this project, you will make a cursory investigation about the Boston housing data and provide your observations. Familiarizing yourself with the data through an explorative process is a fundamental practice to help you better understand and justify your results.</p>
<p>Since the main goal of this project is to construct a working model which has the capability of predicting the value of houses, we will need to separate the dataset into <strong>features</strong> and the <strong>target variable</strong>. The <strong>features</strong>, <code>'RM'</code>, <code>'LSTAT'</code>, and <code>'PTRATIO'</code>, give us quantitative information about each data point. The <strong>target variable</strong>, <code>'MEDV'</code>, will be the variable we seek to predict. These are stored in <code>features</code> and <code>prices</code>, respectively.</p>
<h3>Implementation: Calculate Statistics</h3>
<p>For coding implementation, you will calculate descriptive statistics about the Boston housing prices. Since <code>numpy</code> is already imported, use this library to perform the necessary calculations. These statistics will be extremely important later on to analyze various prediction results from the constructed model.</p>
<p>In the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:
- Calculate the minimum, maximum, mean, median, and standard deviation of <code>'MEDV'</code>, which is stored in <code>prices</code>.
  - Store each calculation in their respective variable.</p>

<h3>Question 1 - Feature Observation</h3>
<p>As a reminder, we are using three features from the Boston housing dataset: <code>'RM'</code>, <code>'LSTAT'</code>, and <code>'PTRATIO'</code>. For each data point (neighborhood):
- <code>'RM'</code> is the average number of rooms among homes in the neighborhood.
- <code>'LSTAT'</code> is the percentage of homeowners in the neighborhood considered "lower class" (working poor).
- <code>'PTRATIO'</code> is the ratio of students to teachers in primary and secondary schools in the neighborhood.</p>
<p><strong> Using your intuition, for each of the three features above, do you think that an increase in the value of that feature would lead to an </strong>increase<strong> in the value of <code>'MEDV'</code> or a </strong>decrease<strong> in the value of <code>'MEDV'</code>? Justify your answer for each.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hint:</strong> This problem can phrased using examples like below.<br>
<em> Would you expect a home that has an <code>'RM'</code> value(number of rooms) of 6 be worth more or less than a home that has an <code>'RM'</code> value of 7?
</em> Would you expect a neighborhood that has an <code>'LSTAT'</code> value(percent of lower class workers) of 15 have home prices be worth more or less than a neighborhood that has an <code>'LSTAT'</code> value of 20?
* Would you expect a neighborhood that has an <code>'PTRATIO'</code> value(ratio of students to teachers) of 10 have home prices be worth more or less than a neighborhood that has an <code>'PTRATIO'</code> value of 15?</p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>  'RM' value - 'RM' value of 7 will be worth more than 'RM' value of 6. More number of rooms gives more space to a family which is generally preferred. Increase in number of rooms increases the value of the home.</p>
<p>'LSTAT' value - 'LSTAT' of 15 will be worth more than 'LSTAT' value of 20. 'LSTAT' will influence the value of the house. If the percentage of low income class is more, the value of the house cannot be priced higher, since the neighborhood will not be able to afford it. If the house remains on the market for a longer time, it loses it value. Hence, the percentage of LSTAT influences the house price.</p>
<p>'PTRATIO' value - a PTRATIO of 10 have home prices be worth more than a neighborhood that has an 'PTRATIO' value of 15. If there are more teachers for students, meaning less students to manage per teacher, this will also influence the home value - increase the home value. This indicates the school district is good, the teachers are able to give more attention to the students.</p>

<h2>Developing a Model</h2>
<p>In this second section of the project, you will develop the tools and techniques necessary for a model to make a prediction. Being able to make accurate evaluations of each model's performance through the use of these tools and techniques helps to greatly reinforce the confidence in your predictions.</p>
<h3>Implementation: Define a Performance Metric</h3>
<p>It is difficult to measure the quality of a given model without quantifying its performance over training and testing. This is typically done using some type of performance metric, whether it is through calculating some type of error, the goodness of fit, or some other useful measurement. For this project, you will be calculating the <a href="http://stattrek.com/statistics/dictionary.aspx?definition=coefficient_of_determination"><em>coefficient of determination</em></a>, R<sup>2</sup>, to quantify your model's performance. The coefficient of determination for a model is a useful statistic in regression analysis, as it often describes how "good" that model is at making predictions. </p>
<p>The values for R<sup>2</sup> range from 0 to 1, which captures the percentage of squared correlation between the predicted and actual values of the <strong>target variable</strong>. A model with an R<sup>2</sup> of 0 is no better than a model that always predicts the <em>mean</em> of the target variable, whereas a model with an R<sup>2</sup> of 1 perfectly predicts the target variable. Any value between 0 and 1 indicates what percentage of the target variable, using this model, can be explained by the <strong>features</strong>. <em>A model can be given a negative R<sup>2</sup> as well, which indicates that the model is <strong>arbitrarily worse</strong> than one that always predicts the mean of the target variable.</em></p>
<p>For the <code>performance_metric</code> function in the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:
- Use <code>r2_score</code> from <code>sklearn.metrics</code> to perform a performance calculation between <code>y_true</code> and <code>y_predict</code>.
- Assign the performance score to the <code>score</code> variable.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># TODO: Import &#39;r2_score&#39;</span>

    <span class="c1"># Return the score</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">score</span>
</pre></div>


<h3>Question 2 - Goodness of Fit</h3>
<p>Assume that a dataset contains five data points and a model made the following predictions for the target variable:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="center">True Value</th>
<th align="center">Prediction</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="center">3.0</td>
<td align="center">2.5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">-0.5</td>
<td align="center">0.0</td>

<td align="center">7.0</td>
<td align="center">7.8</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">4.2</td>
<td align="center">5.3</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Run the code cell below to use the <code>performance_metric</code> function and calculate this model's coefficient of determination.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># Calculate the performance of this model</span>

</pre></div>


<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Model has a coefficient of determination, R^2, of 0.923.
</pre></div>


<ul>
<li>Would you consider this model to have successfully captured the variation of the target variable? </li>
<li>Why or why not?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> Hint: </strong>  The R2 score is the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable. In other words:
<em> R2 score of 0 means that the dependent variable cannot be predicted from the independent variable.
</em> R2 score of 1 means the dependent variable can be predicted from the independent variable.
<em> R2 score between 0 and 1 indicates the extent to which the dependent variable is predictable. An 
</em> R2 score of 0.40 means that 40 percent of the variance in Y is predictable from X.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes. the model has successfully captured the variation of the target variable.</p>
<p>Model has a coefficient of determination, R^2, of 0.923.</p>
<p>In general, the higher the R-squared, the better the model fits your data.</p>
<h3>Implementation: Shuffle and Split Data</h3>
<p>Your next implementation requires that you take the Boston housing dataset and split the data into training and testing subsets. Typically, the data is also shuffled into a random order when creating the training and testing subsets to remove any bias in the ordering of the dataset.</p>
<p>For the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:
- Use <code>train_test_split</code> from <code>sklearn.cross_validation</code> to shuffle and split the <code>features</code> and <code>prices</code> data into training and testing sets.
  - Split the data into 80% training and 20% testing.
  - Set the <code>random_state</code> for <code>train_test_split</code> to a value of your choice. This ensures results are consistent.
- Assign the train and testing splits to <code>X_train</code>, <code>X_test</code>, <code>y_train</code>, and <code>y_test</code>.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Training and testing split was successful.
</pre></div>


<h3>Question 3 - Training and Testing</h3>
<ul>
<li>What is the benefit to splitting a dataset into some ratio of training and testing subsets for a learning algorithm?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hint:</strong> Think about how overfitting or underfitting is contingent upon how splits on data is done.</p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong> In machine learning, we usually split the dataset into training and testing subsets. We train our model on training dataset and test the model on test dataset. We make our predictions and check for accuracy. If we train our model on the train dataset and test it on the same dataset, there is high chance of over-fitting. The benefit is to avoid over-fitting and under-fitting the model.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Analyzing Model Performance</h2>
<p>In this third section of the project, you'll take a look at several models' learning and testing performances on various subsets of training data. Additionally, you'll investigate one particular algorithm with an increasing <code>'max_depth'</code> parameter on the full training set to observe how model complexity affects performance. Graphing your model's performance based on varying criteria can be beneficial in the analysis process, such as visualizing behavior that may not have been apparent from the results alone.</p>
<h3>Learning Curves</h3>
<p>The following code cell produces four graphs for a decision tree model with different maximum depths. Each graph visualizes the learning curves of the model for both training and testing as the size of the training set is increased. Note that the shaded region of a learning curve denotes the uncertainty of that curve (measured as the standard deviation). The model is scored on both the training and testing sets using R<sup>2</sup>, the coefficient of determination.  </p>
<p>Run the code cell below and use these graphs to answer the following question.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># Produce learning curves for varying training set sizes and maximum depths</span>
<span class="n">vs</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">ModelLearning</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">features</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">prices</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p><img alt="png" src="/images/boston_21_0.png"></p>
<h3>Question 4 - Learning the Data</h3>
<ul>
<li>Choose one of the graphs above and state the maximum depth for the model. </li>
<li>What happens to the score of the training curve as more training points are added? What about the testing curve? </li>
<li>Would having more training points benefit the model? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hint:</strong> Are the learning curves converging to particular scores? Generally speaking, the more data you have, the better. But if your training and testing curves are converging with a score above your benchmark threshold, would this be necessary?
Think about the pros and cons of adding more training points based on if the training and testing curves are converging.</p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong> Graph with Max depth 3 shows good results. Adding more training points will benefit the model. Learning curves seem to converge around scores of 300.</p>
<h3>Complexity Curves</h3>
<p>The following code cell produces a graph for a decision tree model that has been trained and validated on the training data using different maximum depths. The graph produces two complexity curves — one for training and one for validation. Similar to the <strong>learning curves</strong>, the shaded regions of both the complexity curves denote the uncertainty in those curves, and the model is scored on both the training and validation sets using the <code>performance_metric</code> function.  </p>
<p><strong> Run the code cell below and use this graph to answer the following two questions Q5 and Q6. </strong></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">vs</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">ModelComplexity</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">X_train</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">y_train</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p><img alt="png" src="/images/boston_25_0.png"></p>
<h3>Question 5 - Bias-Variance Tradeoff</h3>
<ul>
<li>When the model is trained with a maximum depth of 1, does the model suffer from high bias or from high variance? </li>
<li>How about when the model is trained with a maximum depth of 10? What visual cues in the graph justify your conclusions?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hint:</strong> High bias is a sign of underfitting(model is not complex enough to pick up the nuances in the data) and high variance is a sign of overfitting(model is by-hearting the data and cannot generalize well). Think about which model(depth 1 or 10) aligns with which part of the tradeoff.</p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong> Bias is an error from erroneous assumption. High bias results in under-fitting a model. When the model is trained with maximum depth of 1, the model suffers from high bias.</p>
<p>Variance is an error from sensitivity to small fluctuations in training set. High variance results in over-fitting a model. When the model is trained with max depth of 10, it suffers from high variance</p>
<h3>Question 6 - Best-Guess Optimal Model</h3>
<ul>
<li>Which maximum depth do you think results in a model that best generalizes to unseen data? </li>
<li>What intuition lead you to this answer?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> Hint: </strong> Look at the graph above Question 5 and see where the validation scores lie for the various depths that have been assigned to the model. Does it get better with increased depth? At what point do we get our best validation score without overcomplicating our model? And remember, Occams Razor states "Among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected."</p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong> Max depth between 3 and 4 would result in a model that best generalizes the unseen data.</p>
<p>The graph of Max depth 4 shows promising results - that is the intuition.</p>

<h2>Evaluating Model Performance</h2>
<p>In this final section of the project, you will construct a model and make a prediction on the client's feature set using an optimized model from <code>fit_model</code>.</p>
<h3>Question 7 - Grid Search</h3>
<ul>
<li>What is the grid search technique?</li>
<li>How it can be applied to optimize a learning algorithm?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> Hint: </strong> When explaining the Grid Search technique, be sure to touch upon why it is used,  what the 'grid' entails and what the end goal of this method is. To solidify your answer, you can also give an example of a parameter in a model that can be optimized using this approach.</p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>  Grid search is the traditional way of performing hyperparameter optimization. It is an exhaustive searching through a manually specified subset of hyperparameter space of a learning algorithm. A grid search algorithm is guided by some performance metric, typically measured by cross-validation on the training set.</p>
<p>We pass a parameter of values to GridSearchCV to find the optimal hyperparameter. For example, on a decision tree, we pass max_depth(2, 5, 10), criterion(gini or entripy), min_samples_leaf(1,2,10), min_samples_split(2,10,10). The GridSearch then returns the best hyperparamter for the training set which we use.</p>
<h3>Question 8 - Cross-Validation</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What is the k-fold cross-validation training technique? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What benefit does this technique provide for grid search when optimizing a model?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hint:</strong> When explaining the k-fold cross validation technique, be sure to touch upon what 'k' is, how the dataset is split into different parts for training and testing and the number of times it is run based on the 'k' value.</p>
<p>When thinking about how k-fold cross validation helps grid search, think about the main drawbacks of grid search which are hinged upon <strong>using a particular subset of data for training or testing</strong> and how k-fold cv could help alleviate that. You can refer to the <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html#cross-validation">docs</a> for your answer.</p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong> Cross Validation is a technique which allows how results of a statistical model will generalize to an independent dataset. Cross Validation allows us to make a better search of the parameter.</p>
<p>In k-fold cross validation, the original sample is randomly partitioned into k equal subsamples. One sample is used as testing set and the union of k-1 subsamples are used as training sets. The cross-validation process is repeated k times with each of the k subsamples. The average of the accuracies is used as the estimate of the sample accuracy.</p>
<p>The advantage of using k-fold over grid search is all the observations are used for both training and testing.</p>
<h3>Implementation: Fitting a Model</h3>
<p>Your final implementation requires that you bring everything together and train a model using the <strong>decision tree algorithm</strong>. To ensure that you are producing an optimized model, you will train the model using the grid search technique to optimize the <code>'max_depth'</code> parameter for the decision tree. The <code>'max_depth'</code> parameter can be thought of as how many questions the decision tree algorithm is allowed to ask about the data before making a prediction. Decision trees are part of a class of algorithms called <em>supervised learning algorithms</em>.</p>
<p>In addition, you will find your implementation is using <code>ShuffleSplit()</code> for an alternative form of cross-validation (see the <code>'cv_sets'</code> variable). While it is not the K-Fold cross-validation technique you describe in <strong>Question 8</strong>, this type of cross-validation technique is just as useful!. The <code>ShuffleSplit()</code> implementation below will create 10 (<code>'n_splits'</code>) shuffled sets, and for each shuffle, 20% (<code>'test_size'</code>) of the data will be used as the <em>validation set</em>. While you're working on your implementation, think about the contrasts and similarities it has to the K-fold cross-validation technique.</p>
<p>Please note that ShuffleSplit has different parameters in scikit-learn versions 0.17 and 0.18.
For the <code>fit_model</code> function in the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:
- Use <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor.html"><code>DecisionTreeRegressor</code></a> from <code>sklearn.tree</code> to create a decision tree regressor object.
  - Assign this object to the <code>'regressor'</code> variable.
- Create a dictionary for <code>'max_depth'</code> with the values from 1 to 10, and assign this to the <code>'params'</code> variable.
- Use <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html"><code>make_scorer</code></a> from <code>sklearn.metrics</code> to create a scoring function object.
  - Pass the <code>performance_metric</code> function as a parameter to the object.
  - Assign this scoring function to the <code>'scoring_fnc'</code> variable.
- Use <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/0.17/modules/generated/sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV.html"><code>GridSearchCV</code></a> from <code>sklearn.grid_search</code> to create a grid search object.
  - Pass the variables <code>'regressor'</code>, <code>'params'</code>, <code>'scoring_fnc'</code>, and <code>'cv_sets'</code> as parameters to the object. 
  - Assign the <code>GridSearchCV</code> object to the <code>'grid'</code> variable.</p>

<h3>Making Predictions</h3>
<p>Once a model has been trained on a given set of data, it can now be used to make predictions on new sets of input data. In the case of a <em>decision tree regressor</em>, the model has learned <em>what the best questions to ask about the input data are</em>, and can respond with a prediction for the <strong>target variable</strong>. You can use these predictions to gain information about data where the value of the target variable is unknown — such as data the model was not trained on.</p>
<h3>Question 9 - Optimal Model</h3>
<ul>
<li>What maximum depth does the optimal model have? How does this result compare to your guess in <strong>Question 6</strong>?  </li>
</ul>
<p>Run the code block below to fit the decision tree regressor to the training data and produce an optimal model.</p>

<p><strong> Hint: </strong> The answer comes from the output of the code snipped above.</p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong> Parameter 'max_depth' is 4 for the optimal model. Guess was for max_depth between 3 and 4; with 4 showing promising results.</p>
<h3>Question 10 - Predicting Selling Prices</h3>
<p>Imagine that you were a real estate agent in the Boston area looking to use this model to help price homes owned by your clients that they wish to sell. You have collected the following information from three of your clients:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="center">Feature</th>
<th align="center">Client 1</th>
<th align="center">Client 2</th>
<th align="center">Client 3</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="center">Total number of rooms in home</td>
<td align="center">5 rooms</td>
<td align="center">4 rooms</td>
<td align="center">8 rooms</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">Neighborhood poverty level (as %)</td>
<td align="center">17%</td>
<td align="center">32%</td>
<td align="center">3%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">Student-teacher ratio of nearby schools</td>
<td align="center">15-to-1</td>
<td align="center">22-to-1</td>
<td align="center">12-to-1</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<ul>
<li>What price would you recommend each client sell his/her home at? </li>
<li>Do these prices seem reasonable given the values for the respective features? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hint:</strong> Use the statistics you calculated in the <strong>Data Exploration</strong> section to help justify your response.  Of the three clients, client 3 has has the biggest house, in the best public school neighborhood with the lowest poverty level; while client 2 has the smallest house, in a neighborhood with a relatively high poverty rate and not the best public schools.</p>
<p>Run the code block below to have your optimized model make predictions for each client's home.</p>

</pre></div>


<p><strong>Answer: </strong></p>
<p>Predicted selling price for Client 1's home: $404,911.11</p>
<p>Predicted selling price for Client 2's home: $212,223.53</p>
<p>Predicted selling price for Client 3's home: $938,053.85</p>
<h3>Sensitivity</h3>
<p>An optimal model is not necessarily a robust model. Sometimes, a model is either too complex or too simple to sufficiently generalize to new data. Sometimes, a model could use a learning algorithm that is not appropriate for the structure of the data given. Other times, the data itself could be too noisy or contain too few samples to allow a model to adequately capture the target variable — i.e., the model is underfitted. </p>
<p><strong>Run the code cell below to run the <code>fit_model</code> function ten times with different training and testing sets to see how the prediction for a specific client changes with respect to the data it's trained on.</strong></p>

<h3>Question 11 - Applicability</h3>
<ul>
<li>In a few sentences, discuss whether the constructed model should or should not be used in a real-world setting.  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hint:</strong> Take a look at the range in prices as calculated in the code snippet above. Some questions to answering:
- How relevant today is data that was collected from 1978? How important is inflation?
- Are the features present in the data sufficient to describe a home? Do you think factors like quality of apppliances in the home, square feet of the plot area, presence of pool or not etc should factor in?
- Is the model robust enough to make consistent predictions?
- Would data collected in an urban city like Boston be applicable in a rural city?
- Is it fair to judge the price of an individual home based on the characteristics of the entire neighborhood?</p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong> The constructed model is used on data from 1978. Prices were mulitplicatively scaled for the next 30 years adjusting to inflation. </p>
<p>The model can be used to give an estimate on basic features like number of rooms, student-teacher ratio (school district) and income ratio. Factors like quality of appliances in the home, square feet of the plot area, presence of pool do factor in the home value. </p>
<p>The model does give a basic value to predict the price of the home. In today's scenario, we can also add more features like age of the home, amenities inside the home, access to freeways(specially in areas like California, New York, New Jersey) or public transportation. </p>
<p>Data collected in an urban city like Boston may not be applicable in a rural city. We need to keep in mind, that rural areas tend to have more land leading to bigger homes. Urban area due to it's higher employment, is more populated leading to smaller homes. </p>
<p>Is it fair to judge the price of an individual home based on the characteristics of entire neighborhood?
We can get an estimate on the base price of an individual home. There are other factors to be considered too, like number of rooms that could determine the price of the home.</p></div>
